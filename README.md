# Exploratory Data Analysis in Pokemon dataset.

This repository contains a **Exploratory Data Analysis** over the dataset available at the [Kaggle Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon).

The objective of the notebook is to review the basic steps using to run an EDA with Python, so that anyone can achieve the same results as me using the steps I followed in JupyterLab Notebook. Very basic commands were used with some very interesting and not common.

# Project libraries

All dependencies can be found in the file  `requirements.txt`, but are also listed below:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* JupyterLab Notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

To install the dependencies run in the project's main folder : `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

To access the JupyterLab Notebook that I created, run in the root folder of the `jupyter notebook` project. Soon after, your browser will open and just select the file `eda_pokemon.ipynb`.  

# Project structure

```{sh}
  .
  |-dataset
  |  |- pokemon.csv
  |- Beda_pokemon.ipynb
  |- requirements.txt
```

# Comments

Python is very useful to generate insights about the data. With very simple commands it is possible to see numbers and amazing graphics.
